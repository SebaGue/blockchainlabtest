We are very excited, as local supporting organization and sponsor of Scaling Bitcoin 2016, to announce our involvement in the Scaling Bitcoin Week (for more information about Scaling Bitcoin, take a look [here](https://scalingbitcoin.org))

The conference will take place at Politecnico of Milano on 8th and 9th of October. 
Unfortunately, the event is sold-out, but you will still be able to participate via the live stream, IRC, and Twitter. Stay tuned! 

After the conference, the Core hack days will take place in our office on 10th and 11th of October. The event is reserved for bitcoin expert devs. [For more information](http://coredev.tech/nextmeeting.html)
