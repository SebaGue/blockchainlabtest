Jameson Lopp, Bitgo engineer, joined us in our lab and gave a very stimulating presentation entitled: “Bitgo engineering. Lessons learned”. You can find the full video [here](https://youtu.be/u8jLldyInvI)

A lot of people came (considering it was 16th of August!), and, since Copernico caffé was closed for holidays, we had to arrange ourselves for an alternative sushi based dinner.
